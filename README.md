# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
This project was conducted on behalf of Pewlett Hackard's Human Resources department in order to assist with preparations for a high-volume of upcoming retirements. This comes out of a push for departments to begin succession planning sooner rather than later, which would allow junior staff members to benefit from partaking in a mentorship program. The major points investigated in this analysis are the following:

- The number of employees approaching retirement age
- The unique number of employees approaching retirement age
- The number of employees approaching retirement age by job title
- The number of employees who qualify to partake in a mentorship program 

## Results and Summary

In the coming years, Pewlett Hackard could see more than 70,000 employees prepare for retirement. There is a massive amount of preparation that must go into replacing this workforce, as many of these individuals have been with the company for quite some time.

Figure 1 above visualizes the number of upcoming retirements by their titles. Perhaps most worrisome is the high number of senior engineers preparing to retire. A query that should be run in the near future is to determine how many junior engineers are ready to move up to a senior position. This would help determine how many of the senior positions can be filled internally vs. how many would need to be recruited externally. It would also be worthwhile to investigate how many repeat titles there are within each department to assess if every single position needs to be backfilled, or if perhaps redundancies exist that can be mitigated. 

As far as the mentorship program is concerned, there are plenty retirement-age employees to mentor the next generation. The concern is actually that the number of eligible employees is much less than the number of employees approaching retirement. Even if the company prepares for this transition now, there will still need to be a massive recruitment campaign over the coming years to fill the void.
